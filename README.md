# Postman-Collections
A listing of Postman Collections for the Brightspace API

# Start here!
If you are new to the Brightspace API then we recommend you start with these two repositories:

1. GetInitialToken - https://github.com/Brightspace/Postman-Collections/tree/master/GetInitialToken
1. WhoAmI - https://github.com/Brightspace/Postman-Collections/tree/master/WhoAmI

These Collections provide a hands-on Brightspace API Authentication Guide.
