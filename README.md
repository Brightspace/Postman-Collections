# Postman-Collections
A listing of Postman Collections for the Brightspace API

# Start here!
If you are new to the Brightspace API then we recommend you start with these two collections as they **walk you through the Brightspace API OAuth 2.0 Authentication process**:

## GetInitialToken

https://github.com/Brightspace/Postman-Collections/tree/master/GetInitialToken

The purpose of this collection is to provide a guide for generating an initial OAuth 2.0 Access Token and Refresh Token.

## WhoAmI

https://github.com/Brightspace/Postman-Collections/tree/master/WhoAmI

The purpose of this Collection is to provide a basic introduction on how to retrieve a new OAuth 2.0 Access Token based on a valid Refresh Token. Once this is done, the collection shows how you can use the Access Token to perform the Brightspace API WhoAmI call.

# Dive Deeper
Once you have learned Brightspace API Authentication you can now start using all of the other collections in this repository.

## Most Recent Updates

Since September 2020's Fusion Extensibility Lab, we have launched 3 new Collections!
1. LTI 1.1 - A reference Collection for all LTI 1.1 related API routes
2. Distribute an Announcement - Provides a Runner guide for blasting a News Item out to many Courses
3. Bulk Special Access - Provides a single bulk process to apply Special Access rules for Learners across multiple courses and Learning Activity Types.

**All three new Collections were created based on Customer Requests in the Brightspace Community.**
