# Postman-Collections
A listing of Postman Collections for the Brightspace API

# Start here!
If you are new to the Brightspace API then we recommend you start with these two collections as they **walk you through the Brightspace API OAuth 2.0 Authentication process**:

## GetInitialToken

https://github.com/Brightspace/Postman-Collections/tree/master/GetInitialToken

The purpose of this collection is to provide a guide for generating an initial OAuth 2.0 Access Token and Refresh Token.

## WhoAmI

https://github.com/Brightspace/Postman-Collections/tree/master/WhoAmI

The purpose of this Collection is to provide a basic introduction on how to retrieve a new OAuth 2.0 Access Token based on a valid Refresh Token. Once this is done, the collection shows how you can use the Access Token to perform the Brightspace API WhoAmI call.

# Dive Deeper
Once you have learned Brightspace API Authentication you can now start using all of the other collections in this repository.
