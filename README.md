# Postman-Collections
A listing of Postman Collections for the Brightspace API

# Start here!
If you are new to the Brightspace API then we recommend you start with these two collections as they **walk you through the Brightspace API OAuth 2.0 Authentication process**:

## GetInitialToken

https://github.com/Brightspace/Postman-Collections/tree/master/GetInitialToken

The purpose of this collection is to provide a guide for generating an initial OAuth 2.0 Access Token and Refresh Token.

## WhoAmI

https://github.com/Brightspace/Postman-Collections/tree/master/WhoAmI

The purpose of this Collection is to provide a basic introduction on how to retrieve a new OAuth 2.0 Access Token based on a valid Refresh Token. Once this is done, the collection shows how you can use the Access Token to perform the Brightspace API WhoAmI call.

# Dive Deeper
Once you have learned Brightspace API Authentication you can now start using these Postman Collections which highlight different routes and solutions.

## Create a Course, a User, and an Enrollment

https://github.com/Brightspace/Postman-Collections/tree/master/Create%20a%20Course%20a%20User%20and%20an%20Enrollment

This Collection provides a recipe for creating a new Course Offering, and a new Brightspace User. Lastly, it enrolls the new User into the new Course Offering.

## Data Hub

https://github.com/Brightspace/Postman-Collections/tree/master/Data%20Hub

This Collection outlines two key API routes which allow for the discovery and download of Brightspace Data Sets.

## Source and Destination Course

https://github.com/Brightspace/Postman-Collections/tree/master/Source%20and%20Destination%20Course

This Collection takes a Course Template as input. It then shows how to create "Source" course and "Destination" course children for the provided course template. Lastly, it initiates a Course Copy process to copy the components from the Source to the Destination.

## Notification Settings

https://github.com/Brightspace/Postman-Collections/tree/master/NotificationSettings

This Collection allows the API update of Brightspace Notification Settings by a Service Account.
